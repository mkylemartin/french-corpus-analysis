# french-corpus-analysis
Analysis assignment for LING 440

In this assignment I wanted to try a few different things on my 24,000,000 word french news corpus:
1. Frequency list of n-grams (I did 2, 3, 4, 5 grams)
2. Implement a library using Markov chains to generate sentences from the corpus; I used [`markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).
3. Write a custom concordance function that could help me disambiguate meanings between four semantically similar verbs `sortir`, `partir`, `quitter`, `laisser`.
4. Determine if certain newspapers referenced more named entities than others.
